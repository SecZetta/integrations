  <Description>Identity creation rules are used to set attributes on new Identity objects when they are created.  New identities may be created during the aggregation of application accounts, or optionally created after pass-through authentication.

One common operation is to change the name property of the identity when the default application name is complex (such as a directory DN).

Another common operation is to assign a set of initial capabilities based on the attributes pulled from the application account.</Description>
