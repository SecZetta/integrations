## Overview

CyberArk Remote Access (formerly Aleroâ„¢) combines Zero Trust access, biometric multi-factor authentication and just-in-time provisioning into one SaaS-based offering. Remote Access is designed to provide fast, easy and secure privileged access to 3rd party vendors who need access to critical internal systems via CyberArk, without the need to use passwords. By not requiring VPNs or agents Remote Access removes operational overhead for administrators, makes it easier and quicker to deploy and improves organizational security.

SecZetta's integration into Cyberark Remote Access is focused on the onboarding / offboarding of all non-employees that SecZetta is managing. The SecZetta onboarding process can be minimally changed to add extra steps to automatically send out CyberArk Remote Access invitiations. This will ensure your vendors have the ability to securely RDP into the proper environment securely.

> See CyberArk's API Documentation Here: https://api.alero.io/swagger-ui.html#/

### Examples

> The SecZetta Instance URL will be in this format: `https://<seczetta-tenant>.mynonemployee.com`.

> Example SecZetta API Token: `c7aef210f92142188032f5a7b59ed0f6`

## Configuration

The configuration on the SecZetta side is all inside workflows using the REST API action. CyberArk has an api endpoint for sending out vendor invites and managing those invites after the fact (e.g. `https://api.alero.io/v1-edge/invitations/vendor-invitations`)

For documentation purposes no approvals or extra SecZetta workflows will be shown, but understand that all of these extra features can be layered on top of this integration.

There is also a powerpoint script that CyberArk provides its partners/customers that might be useful for those who want to dig deeper into the technical side of the integration. See that script in the repo [here](alero-helper.ps1)

### Creating the REST API Action

For CyberArk, the `OAuth2 w/private key jwt` authentication option will be used to call the API endpoint. Assuming you have the required pre-requisites, the configuration is very simple.
